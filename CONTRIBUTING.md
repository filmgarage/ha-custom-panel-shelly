## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions are very welcome! If you‚Äôd like to help improve this project:

1. **Fork** the repository on GitHub.
2. **Create a feature branch** for your changes (`git checkout -b feature/my-feature`).
3. **Make your edits** and test them inside Home Assistant.
4. **Commit** your work with clear messages and submit a **pull request**.

### Guidelines

* Follow Home Assistant‚Äôs [frontend development guidelines](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/frontend/).
* Keep the UI clean and consistent with existing Home Assistant design.
* Include comments in your code where needed.
* Update the `CHANGELOG.md` and `README.md` with any relevant changes.
* Keep in mind! If Home Assistant is capable of doing it (firmware updates, automations etc it doesn't belong here).

If you plan to work on one of the roadmap items, feel free to open an issue first to discuss the approach.
