## ðŸ§­ Roadmap / Future Plans

### Planned for 0.2.x

* **Entity cleanup**: automatically hide or flag entities that do not belong to Shelly devices.
* **Security overview**: provide a clear table of all safety-related functions per device, including:

  * Access Point availability
  * Authentication password enabled/disabled
  * Bluetooth state (on/off)
  * Cloud connection state
  * Firmware update status (read-only summary)
* **Batch control tools**: allow editing of multiple Shelly devices at once, e.g. toggling Bluetooth or Cloud settings in bulk.
* **Advanced filtering**: implement filtering and grouping similar to Home Assistantâ€™s built-in table views for better usability.

### Longer-term ideas

* Integrate More Info dialogs for quick device diagnostics.
* Support exporting filtered lists to CSV/JSON.
* Possibly integrate configuration templates for standardized Shelly deployments.
